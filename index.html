  <p>Breguet achivements in watchmaking year by year:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>1775–1780</b>: Improved the automatic winding mechanism – his perpetual watch.</li>
    <li><b>1783</b>: Invented the gong for repeater watches (bells were used until then).</li>
    <li><b>1783</b>: Designed the apple-shaped (aiguilles à pomme) hands, known as 'Breguet' hands. These hollow, eccentric "moon" tip hands are a variant of the hands first used by Jean-Antoine Lépine, the only difference is that Lépine's hands were not eccentric. Since their invention, Breguet hands have graced watch and clock dials alike until today.</li>
    <li><b>1787</b>: Adopted and improved the lever escapement. Abraham-Louis Breguet used it in its definitive form from 1814 (this form is still in use).</li>
    <li><b>1790</b>: Invented the 'pare-chute' anti-shock device.</li>
    <li><b>1793</b>: Developed a small watch showing the equation of time.</li>
    <li><b>1794</b>: Invented a retrograde display mechanism.</li>
    <li><b>1795</b>: Invented the Breguet spiral (flat spiral balance spring with overcoil).</li>
    <li><b>1795</b>: Invented the "Sympathique" ('sympathetic') clock, a master carriage clock which rewinds and sets to time a detachable pocket watch.</li>
    <li><b>1799</b> Invented the montre a tact ("tact") watch that could be read by feel in the pocket or the dark.</li>
    <li><b>1801</b>: Patented the tourbillon escapement, developed circa 1795.</li>
    <li><b>1802</b>: Invented the echappement naturel, a double-escape wheeled chronometer escapement that needed no oil.</li>
    <li><b>1821</b>: Developed the "inking" chronograph, in partnership with Frédérick Louis Fatton.</li>
